### Backend

```
/backend
â”œâ”€â”€ .__pycache__/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ API_KEY
â”œâ”€â”€ .idea/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ modules and script
â”‚   	â””â”€â”€ All downloaded dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ use.py - splits the pdf into smaller segments	
â”œâ”€â”€ text_gen.py
â”œâ”€â”€ video_gen.py
â””â”€â”€ final_vide.mp4 - the final output generated
```
## ðŸ§ž Commands for Frontend

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `fastn build`            | FASTN builder installs all `FASTN` dependencies        |
| `fastn serve`            | Starts local dev server at available port`localhost:8000`          |

## ðŸ§ž  Commands for Backend Setup

This repository contains a backend folder in which there are scripts for text generation and video generation from PDFs.

### Structure

- `text_gen.py`: Script for generating text using OpenAI's GPT-3 model.
- `textgen_pdf.py`: Script for generating videos from PDFs.
- `api_key.py`: Python file to store your OpenAI API key.
- `Osi_model.pdf`: Sample PDF file used for text generation (you can replace it with your own PDF).

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a file named `api_key.py` in the same directory as the scripts:

    ```bash
    echo "API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key_here'" > api_key.py
    ```

    Replace `'your_openai_api_key_here'` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. Run `text_gen.py` to generate text:

    ```bash
    python text_gen.py
    ```

6. Run `textgen_pdf.py` to generate videos from a PDF file:

    ```bash
    python textgen_pdf.py
    ```

Make sure you have a PDF file in the same directory. You can use any PDF file of your choice. For example, we have provided `Osi_model.pdf` as a sample.

### Notes

- Ensure that the PDF file you want to use for text generation is in the same directory as the script.
- Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key in `api_key.py`.
