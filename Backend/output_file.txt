Cloud computing is a type of computing that relies on shared computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications.In cloud computing, the word cloud (also phrased as "the cloud") is used as a metaphor for "the Internet," so the phrase cloud computing means "a type of Internet-based computing,"where different services � such as servers, storage and applications � are delivered to an organization's computers and devices through the Internet.Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (example, networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a public utility.Third-party clouds enable organizations to focus on their core businesses instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance.
